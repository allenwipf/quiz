<!-- Quiz

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, build a quiz game. Here is the spec:

There must be at least 3 questions in the quiz
Use a form field (whatever field you like) to receive the user's answer to a question
At no point in the entire process of using the quiz should the page reload. Submission of a question's answer, restarting the quiz, etc should all just update the currently viewed page's DOM.
Display the current quiz "score" (i.e. number of correct answers and number of total questions asked so far) on the page somewhere -->
